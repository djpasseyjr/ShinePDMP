This repository contains code and latex supporting work done to model campus drinking with a piecewise deterministic Markov process. 

### Contents
#### Directories
1. The `Code` directory contains Python and Julia Code analyzing the EMA data and simulating student drinking. See `Code/README.md` for information about running the code.
2. The `Latex` directory contains latex and images for the some of the project's writeups

#### Write Ups
1. `PDMPModelAnalyticExpectation.pdf` contains a complete description of the model of a single social drinker as well as analytic results about a simpler model.
2. `CoupledDrinkingModel.pdf` displays results of coupling and simulating multiple social drinkers at once.
3. `EMATimeseriesAnalysis.pdf` Contains fourier analysis, stationarity and cross correlation of the EMA data.
